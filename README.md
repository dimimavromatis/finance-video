# finance-video
This repository was created as part of the lecture accompanying examination (LBP) in the Financial Markets and Risk Management course in the Winter Semester 2025/26 at the University of Stuttgart. It contains the Manim code used to generate a video that tries to visually explain the financial risks involved in naked option selling using animations in the style popularized by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)

## Installation
To run the animations locally, make sure you have Python:

Install Manim on your local machine by running the following command in your terminal
```bash
pip install manim
```

To run an animation, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
manim -pql Part01.py Part01
```
If you want to run the second animation, then replace Part01 with Part02 in the command above.
